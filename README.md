# Body-Map
This Jupyter Notebook creates an average image of unaligned images by:
1. aligning them using homography matrix, then
2. blending the aligned images with equal alpha and beta values.

## To get started
Download or relocate images you would like to blend to a separate file and name it "sc".
Running the third cell will align the images and save them to the same file and name them with format "Warped_images_{number}".
Running the next cell outputs result.
